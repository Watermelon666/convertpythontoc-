Make sure you read all of the documentation on how everything works before attempting to use this application. It can be confusing, and frustrating if you have no clue what you are doing.

This application is an ongoing project of mine that I started a few weeks ago. I will be working on the application every day, as I have free time at my job, and choose to spend it doing this.
I will only be pushing out updates once or twice a month, but when I do, they will be large.
In the end, I expect for this application to be able to suit just about anyone.
Stay safe, and be smart.
